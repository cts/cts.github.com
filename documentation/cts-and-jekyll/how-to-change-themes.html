    <h2>Theminator</h2>
    <p>Right now, you only have one theme installed, Mog. We're going to show you how to browse and preview themes; you can see how themes look on your blog, without even have to install them in your directory.</p>
    <p>First, drag this button up to your favorites toolbar:<br><br>
        <button class="btn btn-large btn-primary">Theminator Bookmarklet</button>
    </p>
    <p>Navigate to your blog. This could be the up-and-running site on the web, or it could be running locally.</p>
    <div class="well">
        <strong>How?</strong> If you want to run your site from a local server, you can run <code>jekyll serve</code> in your blog's root directory, which will build the site in the <i>_site</i> folder, then put it on the development server. The default port is 4000 (so you'd go to <a href="localhost:4000">localhost:4000</a>), but you can specify something different in <i>_config.yml</i>.

    <p>Click on your bookmarklet to open the theminator sidebar.</p>

    <div class="span8">
        <p>The Theminator will let you browse through all of the themes that are currently compatible with CTS.<p>
        <br><br>
        <div class="row-fluid">
            
            <div class="span6"><br><p>If you already know the name of the theme you want, you can search for it.</p></div>
            <div class="span6"><img class="span-image border-image" src="../../images/tutorial/theminator-search.png" /></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="row-fluid">
            <div class="span6"><img class="span-image border-image" src="../../images/tutorial/theminator-filter.png" /></div>
            <div class="span6"><br><p>Wordpress themes are described by their colors, columns, width, features, and subject. To search for a theme with specfic tags, check the boxes and press <i>Filter</i>.</p></div>
            
        </div>
        <br><br>
        <div class="row-fluid">
            
            <div class="span6"><br><p>Hover your mouse over a screenshot to see more information about a theme. You'll be able to see the name, <i>Preview</i> and <i>Install</i> buttons, and a <i>Favorites</i> icon (the star). To add a theme to your favorites, just click the star. To remove it, click the star again. If you want to display all of your favorite themes, press the star next to the search field.</p></div>
            <div class="span6"><img class="span-image border-image" src="../../images/tutorial/theminator-mog.png" /></div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <p>To preview a theme, simply click <i>Preview</i> and watch as CTS transforms your blog. To revert it back to how it was, just deselect the <i>Preview</i> button. Once you decide on a theme, click <i>Install</i>, and we'll add all the files you need and change the theme property in <i>_config.yml</i> for you.</p>
    </div>
</div>
<br>
<div class="row-fluid">
    <h2>Terminal</h2>
    <p>You can also add new themes through your terminal.<p>
    <p>Navigate to your blog's root directory and run:</p>
    <pre><code>cts add-theme blog <i>theme</i></code></pre>
    <p>where <i>theme</i> is whatever theme you chose. We'll set up the files and change the theme property in <i>_config.yml</i> --just like if you were to press the <i>Install</i> button in the Theminator.</p>
