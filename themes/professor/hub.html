 <h3>Background</h3>
 <div class="background">
   <p>After springing fully grown from the head of Zeus, I independally derived
   the Church-Turing thesis at 6 months of age. I took a break from my studies
   between the ages of 8 months and 9 months to hike the Himalayas, and then
   was tutored by the Dalai Lama in the art of Belgian waffle making.</p>
